FEDWatcher is sofware to connect up to 4 [FED3 feeder devices](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3/) to one Raspberry Pi 4. The Raspberry Pi communicates with the FED3 devices using software serial from the BNC/headphone jack port of the Adafruit feather into the activated UART channels on the Pi.
